The goal of the Package deppr, or dependence (dep) post-processing (p) in R (r), is to restore a meaningful dependence structure to statistically post-processed univariate forecasts.

## Installation

You can install the latest version from [Github](https://github.com/katerobsau/deppr) 
<!-- And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("katerobsau/deppr")
```

<!-- ## Example -->
<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->
<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(depPPR) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
