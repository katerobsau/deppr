\title{Backward Selection for Minimum Divergence Schaake Shuffle}
\usage{
backward_selection_mindiv(X_mat, H_mat, backward_num)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_mat}{a matrix where rows correspond to different locations and lead times
for a given ensemble forecast. The columns correspond to the number of members.}

\item{H_mat}{a matrix of historical observations. The rows and columns of this
matrix are arranged in such a way that the observational trajectories are
consistent with the locations and lead times of the rows in \code{X_mat}.}

\item{backward_num}{the number of dates to retain after backward selection}
}
\value{
A reduced version of the matrix for \code{H_mat}
with \code{backward_num} columns.
