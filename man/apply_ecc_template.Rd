\title{Performs empirical copula coupling}
\usage{
apply_ecc_template(X_raw, Y_forecast)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_raw}{is a matrix where the columns correspond to the raw ensemble members}

\item{Y_forecast}{is a matrix where the entries correspond to the univariate forecasts}
}
\value{
a matrix where the columns corresponds to the post-processed
multivariate forecasts
}
\description{
Reshuffles univariate forecasts so that the multivariate forecast inherits the
dependence structure the raw ensemble.
}
\details{
Univariate forecasts are generated using \code{sample_ecc_members_norm()}.
These univariate forecasts are then reshuffled using a dependence template
inherited from the raw ensemble, \code{X_raw}. This
process is known as Empircal Copula Coupling (ECC).
The type of ECC depends on the  sampling type used to generate the members in
\code{sample_ecc_members_norm}.

This function is functionally the same as \code{schaake_shuffle()}, but to be
consistent with the formulation in the orginal papers has different inputs.

\examples{
# code for this example was based on the function vs_sample()
# in the scoringRules package

d <- 3  # number of dimensions
m <- 5  # number of ensemble members
mu0 <- rep(0, d)
mu <- rep(1, d)
S0 <- S <- diag(d)
S[S==0] <- 0.1
S0[S0==0] <- 0.2

# generate samples from multivariate normal distributions
obs <- drop(mu0 + rnorm(d) \%*\% chol(S0))
raw_ensemble <- replicate(m, drop(mu + rnorm(d) \%*\% chol(S)))

pars = data.frame(mean = mu0, sd = rep(1, d))
draw_type = 'R'
univariate_forecast <- sample_ecc_members(num_members = m,  rnorm, pars, draw_type)

apply_ecc_template(raw_ensemble, univariate_forecast)
