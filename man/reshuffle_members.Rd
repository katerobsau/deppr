\title{Reshuffle ensemble members using template}
\usage{
reshuffle_members(forecast, template)
}
\arguments{
\item{forecast}{is a matrix where the columns correspond to members with the
unrealistic dependence structure}

\item{template}{is a matrix where the columns correspond to the template for
dependence structure}
}
\value{
a matrix where the members have been reshuffled according to the
dependence template
}
\description{
This function reshuffles the members of a post-processed ensemble forecast
using a template to restore a meaningful dependence structure.
}
\details{
For ensemble members that have been sampled from a post-processed forecast
distribution the members need to be reshuffled to restore a meaningful
dependence structure in space, time or both.

This function uses a template to reshuffle the sampled ensemble members. There
are many option for template selection. In the Schaake shuffle and its variants
the template uses past observations. In Empirical Coupla Coupling, the
dependence template is inherited from the raw ensemble forecast.

\examples{

d <- 3  # number of dimensions (space x time)
m <- 5  # number of members (sampled from the post-process forecast distribution)

set.seed(1)
eg_forecast = matrix(rnorm(d*m), nrow = d)

eg_template = matrix(rnorm(d*m), nrow = d)

forecast_with_dependence = reshuffle_members(eg_forecast, eg_template)

# Checking the forecast was shuffled correctly using the template
order(eg_forecast[1,])
order(eg_template[1,])
order(forecast_with_dependence[1,])

# Checking the forecast still contains the same members after shuffling
sort(eg_forecast[1,])
sort(forecast_with_dependence[1,])
